A password analyzer typically refers to a tool that evaluates the strength of a password or checks if a password has been exposed in known data breaches. The goal is to analyze passwords based on certain criteria like length, complexity, and common patterns.

There are two main types of password analyzers:

    Password Strength Analyzer:
        This tool checks how strong a given password is based on various factors such as:
            Length (longer passwords are generally stronger)
            Complexity (use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters)
            Unpredictability (not based on common patterns or dictionary words)

    Password Leak Analyzer:
        This type checks if the password has been exposed in a data breach or is publicly available, which could make it easy for attackers to guess.

Components of a Password Analyzer:

For building a basic password analyzer, we'll need a few key parts:

    Strength Checker: Evaluates the complexity of a password based on certain rules (e.g., length, mix of characters).
    Password List: Checks the password against common weak passwords (e.g., "123456", "password").
    Hash Check: Checks if the password exists in known breach databases, possibly by comparing it to hash databases or using external services like "Have I Been Pwned."

Password Strength Analyzer: Example Code

Let's build a simple Password Strength Analyzer in Python that checks the strength of a password based on:

    Length
    Presence of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters
    Common password checks (against a predefined list of weak passwords)

import re

def check_password_strength(password):
    # Criteria for password strength
    length_criteria = len(password) >= 8
    lowercase_criteria = re.search(r'[a-z]', password) is not None
    uppercase_criteria = re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) is not None
    number_criteria = re.search(r'[0-9]', password) is not None
    special_char_criteria = re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]', password) is not None

    # Common weak passwords
    weak_passwords = ['123456', 'password', '123456789', 'qwerty', 'abc123']

    # Check if the password is in the weak passwords list
    if password in weak_passwords:
        return "Weak password - commonly used password."

    # Determine overall strength
    if length_criteria and lowercase_criteria and uppercase_criteria and number_criteria and special_char_criteria:
        return "Strong password!"
    elif length_criteria and (lowercase_criteria or uppercase_criteria) and number_criteria:
        return "Moderate password."
    else:
        return "Weak password."

# Example Usage
password = input("Enter a password to check: ")
result = check_password_strength(password)
print(result)

Explanation of the Code:

    Regex Patterns:
        re.search(r'[a-z]', password) checks if there's at least one lowercase letter.
        re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) checks for an uppercase letter.
        re.search(r'[0-9]', password) checks for digits.
        re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]', password) checks for special characters.

    Weak Password List:
        The script checks if the entered password matches common weak passwords like "123456", "password", etc. If it matches, it returns a message saying the password is weak.

    Strength Evaluation:
        If the password passes all the criteria (minimum length, both uppercase and lowercase, digits, and special characters), it is considered a "Strong password."
        If the password meets some but not all criteria, it returns a "Moderate password."
        Otherwise, it returns a "Weak password."

Password Leak Analyzer

To check whether a password has been compromised in a known breach, we can integrate an API such as Have I Been Pwned. This API checks if a password has been exposed in a data breach.

Here's how you could integrate this functionality:

import requests

def check_password_breach(password):
    # Convert the password into its SHA1 hash
    sha1_hash = hashlib.sha1(password.encode()).hexdigest().upper()

    # Split the hash to send only the first 5 characters to the API (this reduces load)
    prefix = sha1_hash[:5]
    suffix = sha1_hash[5:]

    # Send request to the API
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{prefix}")

    # Check if the suffix is in the response (indicating a breach)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        hashes = response.text.splitlines()
        for hash_entry in hashes:
            hash_suffix, count = hash_entry.split(':')
            if hash_suffix == suffix:
                return f"Password has been exposed {count} times in data breaches."
        return "Password is not found in any known breaches."
    else:
        return "Error checking password breach status."

# Example Usage
password = input("Enter a password to check for breaches: ")
result = check_password_breach(password)
print(result)

Explanation of the Code:

    SHA1 Hashing:
        Password is hashed using SHA1 (this is the format the Have I Been Pwned API expects).

    API Request:
        We send the first 5 characters of the hashed password to the https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{prefix} endpoint to reduce load. The API responds with a list of suffixes and the number of times that hash suffix has been found in breaches.

    Check for Breach:
        If the suffix of the hash is found in the response, it means the password has been exposed, and the count of breaches is returned.
        If not, it indicates that the password has not been found in any known breaches.

Combining Both Analyzers

You can combine both parts into one script where the user can check the strength of the password and also see if it has been exposed in a breach.
Final Thoughts:

    Password Strength Analyzer helps evaluate if a password is secure.
    Password Leak Analyzer helps identify if a password has been exposed.
    These tools are useful for improving password security and promoting safer password practices.

Let's build a Password Analyzer that includes both a Password Strength Analyzer and a Password Leak Analyzer (using the Have I Been Pwned API). This tool will help evaluate the strength of a password and check if it has been exposed in known data breaches.
Full Code:

import re
import hashlib
import requests

# Function to check password strength
def check_password_strength(password):
    # Criteria for password strength
    length_criteria = len(password) >= 8
    lowercase_criteria = re.search(r'[a-z]', password) is not None
    uppercase_criteria = re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) is not None
    number_criteria = re.search(r'[0-9]', password) is not None
    special_char_criteria = re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]', password) is not None

    # Common weak passwords list
    weak_passwords = ['123456', 'password', '123456789', 'qwerty', 'abc123']

    # Check if the password is in the weak passwords list
    if password in weak_passwords:
        return "Weak password - commonly used password."

    # Determine overall strength
    if length_criteria and lowercase_criteria and uppercase_criteria and number_criteria and special_char_criteria:
        return "Strong password!"
    elif length_criteria and (lowercase_criteria or uppercase_criteria) and number_criteria:
        return "Moderate password."
    else:
        return "Weak password."

# Function to check if the password is exposed in any data breach
def check_password_breach(password):
    # Convert the password into its SHA1 hash (uppercase)
    sha1_hash = hashlib.sha1(password.encode()).hexdigest().upper()

    # Send only the first 5 characters of the hash (prefix) to the API
    prefix = sha1_hash[:5]
    suffix = sha1_hash[5:]

    # Send request to the Have I Been Pwned API
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{prefix}")

    # If the API request is successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        hashes = response.text.splitlines()
        
        # Iterate through the returned hashes and check if the suffix matches
        for hash_entry in hashes:
            hash_suffix, count = hash_entry.split(':')
            if hash_suffix == suffix:
                return f"Password has been exposed {count} times in data breaches."
        
        return "Password is not found in any known breaches."
    else:
        return "Error checking password breach status."

# Main function to check both password strength and breach status
def analyze_password(password):
    # Check password strength
    strength = check_password_strength(password)
    
    # Check if the password is in known data breaches
    breach_status = check_password_breach(password)
    
    # Return both results
    return strength, breach_status

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    password = input("Enter a password to analyze: ")
    strength, breach_status = analyze_password(password)
    
    print(f"Password Strength: {strength}")
    print(f"Breach Status: {breach_status}")

Explanation of the Code:

    check_password_strength(password):
        Purpose: This function checks how strong a password is based on predefined criteria.
        Criteria:
            Length Criteria: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
            Lowercase Criteria: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
            Uppercase Criteria: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
            Number Criteria: The password must contain at least one number (0-9).
            Special Character Criteria: The password must contain at least one special character (like !@#$%^&*()).
        Weak Password Check: The function checks if the password is one of the common weak passwords such as 123456, password, or abc123.
        Return Values:
            If the password passes all the criteria, it returns "Strong password!".
            If it passes some but not all, it returns "Moderate password.".
            Otherwise, it returns "Weak password.".

    check_password_breach(password):
        Purpose: This function checks if the password has been exposed in a data breach using the Have I Been Pwned API.
        Hashing:
            The password is first converted into a SHA1 hash using Python's hashlib library.
            The hash is then split into a prefix (first 5 characters) and a suffix (remaining characters).
        API Request:
            The function sends a request to the Have I Been Pwned API with the prefix part of the SHA1 hash to minimize data transfer.
            The API returns a list of hashes and how many times each has been exposed in breaches.
        Breach Check:
            The function checks if the suffix of the password's SHA1 hash is found in the list of hashes returned by the API. If found, it means the password has been exposed in a breach.
            If the suffix is found, it returns the number of times it has been exposed.
            If not, it returns "Password is not found in any known breaches.".

    analyze_password(password):
        Purpose: This function calls both the check_password_strength and check_password_breach functions to analyze a given password.
        It returns two results:
            Password strength (strong, moderate, or weak).
            Password breach status (whether the password has been exposed in any breaches).

    Main Block (if __name__ == "__main__":):
        Purpose: This block allows the script to be executed directly from the command line.
        It prompts the user to enter a password and then calls the analyze_password function to display the password's strength and breach status.

Example Output:

For a password 123456 (a common weak password):

Enter a password to analyze: 123456
Password Strength: Weak password - commonly used password.
Breach Status: Password has been exposed 2556 times in data breaches.

For a more secure password (e.g., My$ecureP@ssw0rd):

Enter a password to analyze: My$ecureP@ssw0rd
Password Strength: Strong password!
Breach Status: Password is not found in any known breaches.

Limitations & Upgrades:

    Limitations:
        The strength analyzer is basic and uses simple regex checks. More complex checks (e.g., pattern analysis or entropy-based scoring) could be added.
        The breach check is limited to the data available from the Have I Been Pwned API. Some breaches may not be included, and the API has rate limits.

    Possible Upgrades:
        Implement a password entropy checker: Entropy is a measure of randomness. A higher entropy password is harder to guess.
        Add password dictionary checks: Check the password against a dictionary of known breached passwords or common passwords.
        Use an encrypted connection to securely store the password analysis data or export the results.
        Add a GUI: A graphical user interface (GUI) can make the tool more user-friendly.
